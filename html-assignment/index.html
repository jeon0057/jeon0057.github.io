        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>I am an Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College, currently living in Ottawa. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, on the 24<sup>th</sup> of Janurary, 2001. When I was three years old my family and I moved to Canada. Some of my favourite pastimes are solving puzzles, drawing, and listening to music. When it comes to music, I tend to listen to any song that I find touching or catchy in a variety of genres, depending on my mood. One sad fact about me is I <em>love</em> cats, but I am allergic to them. <br>
        <br>
        I previously studied architecture at Carleton University, but I found myself wanting to explore different options before spending 4+ years completing my degree. During the pandemic, I started learning some HTML and decided to take <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. My goal for the future is to start a career in web development and develop other design skills enough to do freelance work on the side.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Charcoal sketching</li>
